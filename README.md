## mapreduce-simple

Simple and minimal implementation of the MapReduce distributed computation framework [introduced by Jeffrey Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf) @ Google Inc. in 2004.

MapReduce is a programming model and processing technique designed for distributed computing on large datasets. It consists of two main phases: the Map phase, which processes input files/data in parallel, and the Reduce phase, which performs a summary (by key) operation on the mapped data.
