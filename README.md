## mapreduce-simple

Simple and minimal implementation of [the MapReduce distributed computation framework](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf) introduced by Jeffrey Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat @ Google Inc. in 2004.

MapReduce is a programming model and processing technique designed for distributed computing on large datasets. It consists of two main phases: the Map phase, which processes input files/data in parallel, and the Reduce phase, which performs a summary operation on the mapped data by key.

### Status:

In Progress (ðŸš§)

### Objective

Building a minimum viable implementation that produces the same output as a sequential MapReduce applications + graceful exit of all forked threads / goroutines.
